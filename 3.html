<h1>Love of Jesus</h1>
<p>As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you.
    <br> Abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. 
    <br>These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full. 
    <br> â€œThis is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. 
    <br> Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.</p>
