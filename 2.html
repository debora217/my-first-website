<h1>Love of God</h1>
<p>Romans 5:8 - But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</p>

<p>John 3:16 - â€œFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.</p>

<p>1 John 4:16 - So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.</p>
